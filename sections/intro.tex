\section{Introduction}
This document presents the problem of generating synthetic images of
ellipses that will be used as test data in finding the intersection
points between two boundaries. 

\subsection{Definition of the problem}
Generate binary images of ellipses with known parameters,
intersections and relationship between them, \ie\ distance between the
centers and angle between the major axes. Figure
\ref{fig:sec1-shematic} shows the workflow of the problem.

\subsection{Structure and methodology}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Generating the ellipses.
\item Obtaining ground truth intersections.

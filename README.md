# LaTeX Thesis Template
Yet another report or thesis template based on other thesis templates. 

This is the actual main file of the REPORT (thesis) being written. It calls upon other files like the header, footer, as well as each of the individual chapters. The structure is pretty straightforward. 

The location of each of the files: 
 - `docsettings/header.tex`: contains all the document info, the pakages used and macros defined.
 - `docsettings/titlepage.tex`: Contains the title page of the document, in case a specific one is required.
 - `docsettings/prologue.tex`: Contains statements, acknowledgements, etc, that would go before the actual contents.
 - `chapters/intro.tex`: Introductory chapter.
 - `chapters/chaptX.tex`: Chapter X in the document.
 - `chapters/conclusion.tex`: Final chapter.
 - `chapters/appY.tex`: Appendix number Y of the document.
It is advisable to place all the images within the ./pics folder, which is already preselected to hold the images.

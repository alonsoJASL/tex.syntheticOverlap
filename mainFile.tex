% This is the actual main file of the REPORT (thesis) being
% written. It calls upon other files like the header, footer, as well
% as each of the individual chapters.  The structure is pretty
% straightforward.
% 
% The location of each of the files: - docsettings/header.tex:
% contains all the document info, the pakages used and macros defined.
% - docsettings/titlepage.tex: Contains the title page of the
% document, in case a specific one is required.  -
% docsettings/prologue.tex: Contains statements, acknowledgements,
% etc...  that would go before the actual contents.  -
% chapters/intro.tex: Introductory chapter.  - chapters/chaptX.tex:
% Chapter X in the document.  - chapters/conclusion.tex: Final
% chapter.  - chapters/appY.tex: Appendix number Y of the document.
%
% It is advisable to place all the images within the ./pics folder,
% which is already preselected to hold the images.

\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
  This work presents the process of generating synthetic images of
  ellipses from the parametric ellipse equations into a binary
  image. The synthetic images of single ellipses are created in order
  to produce an image of two (or more) overlapping ellipses in which
  the distance between the centers and the angle between the major
  axes is known. These synthetic images of overlapping objects will
  then be used as a basic test dataset for an algorithm that finds
  points of intersection of two (or more) boundaries.
